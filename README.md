# Winegrape Sour Rot Analysis
In this project, we investigated the role of insecticide application and the use 
of netting against fruit flies, on the microbial diversity and composition of 
healthy wine grape berries from tolerant and susceptible varieties.

We also analyzed healthy and sour rot-affected berries to determine the core 
microbiomes involved in the disease complex.
